# Rubber-Stamper

[go/rubber-stamper-user-guide](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/refs/heads/main/go/src/infra/appengine/rubber-stamper/README.md)

Rubber-Stamper provides a security-sensitive bot which can provide timely
second-eyes code review by verifying the safety of CLs that it is asked to
review.

See go/chops-rubber-stamp-bot-design for design plans.

## Rubber Stamper User Guide

### Have Rubber-Stamper review your CLs
For every CL that requires Rubber-Stamper's review, add `Rubber Stamper (rubber-stamper@appspot.gserviceaccount.com)`
as a reviewer. Rubber-Stamper will respond in ~1 min. It will either add a
`Bot-Commit +1` label or leave a comment providing the reason why this CL does
not meet the configured rules and also remove itself as reviewer. The `Bot-Commit +1`
label is not sticky, which means additional patchsets will need to be reviewed.

If you set the Auto-Submit label, Rubber Stamper will also set `Commit-Queue +2`
if it approves the CL.

If a CL does not pass, you can upload a new patchset that addresses the
comments and re-add Rubber-Stamper as a reviewer.

### Expected CL types & intended usage

Currently, our expected CL patterns can be generally divided into two types:
- Changes to benign files (translation, whitespace, test expectation files,
directories that contain no code)
- Clean reverts/cherry-picks

Rubber Stamper never provides OWNERS approval, by design. It's intended to be
used by those who have owners in the directory modified or who are sheriffs. If
it provided both code review and OWNERS approval, that would be an abuse vector:
that would allow anyone who can create a revert or cherry-pick to land it
without any other person being involved and that would allow the insertion of
nonsense into benign files. E.g. the silent revert of security patches.

If you need to add/change pattern configs, go to the first section "Configure
your patterns"; if a pattern is already configured, and you need to use
Rubber-Stamper as a reviewer for CLs, go to the second section "Have
Rubber-Stamper review your CLs".

### Configure your patterns
1. Add a config for your patterns in [config.cfg](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/config/+/refs/heads/main/configs/rubber-stamper/config.cfg).
To edit this config file, clone the [service configurations for LUCI](https://chrome-internal.googlesource.com/infradata/config/) repo.
Config definitions can be found in [config.proto](https://chromium.googlesource.com/infra/infra/+/refs/heads/main/go/src/infra/appengine/rubber-stamper/config/config.proto).
2. Send a review request to xinyuoffline@ and yulanlin@. Once the config change
is submitted, the config will be pushed to Rubber-Stamper via luci-config.

#### Examples of benign file patterns

When you need Rubber-Stamper to treat your files as benign files, you need to
add the path to the files/directories in the config.

The list of filepaths that follow `.gitignore` style ignore patterns, is configured
on a per-repo basis. Here is a sample `repo_config` that allows all `.xtb` filepaths
in `chromium/src`, and a few subpaths for`.txt` files.

    repo_configs {
      key: "chromium/src"
      value: {
        benign_file_pattern {
          paths: "*.xtb"
          paths: "a/b.txt"
          paths: "a/*/c.txt"
          paths: "z/*"
        }
      }
    }

We use the same rule as in `.gitignore` files to parse these `paths`. Here, each
element of `paths` is treated as a line in a `.gitignore` file. Syntax of
`.gitignore` can be found in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). To
be noticed, in a `.gitignore` file, the last matching pattern decides the
outcome. We also follow this rule here. For example, with the following
`repo_config`, file `test/a/1.txt` would be valid, while file
`test/a/b/2.txt` would not be allowed.

    repo_configs {
      key: "chromium/src"
      value: {
        benign_file_pattern {
          paths: "test/a/**",
          paths: "!test/a/b/*",
        }
      }
    }

Note: when a revert/cherry-pick cannot pass the `clean_revert_pattern`/
`clean_cherry_pick_pattern` check, but can pass the `benign_file_pattern`
check, we will still approve the CL because `benign_file_pattern` is used
as a fallback in our design.

#### Examples of clean revert patterns

A revert will be approved if the Gerrit API marks it as a [pure revert](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#get-pure-revert),
it is within the configured `time_window` in the config, and none of the
modified files is in the `excluded_paths`.

A `time_window` represents a length of time in `<int><unit>` form. Reverts need
to be within this `time_window` to be valid. Valid units are `s`, `m`, `h`,
`d`, meaning "seconds", "minutes", "hours", "days" respectively. By default,
Rubber-Stamper has a global `default_time_window` of `7d`, which allows reverts
that are reverted no later than 7 days. You can override this value at a
host-level (by modifying `clean_revert_time_window` in `host_configs`) or
repo-level (by modifying `time_window` in `clean_revert_pattern` of
`repo_configs`). It is always the more granular level that is applied. For
example, in the following config, the global `7d`, host-level `1h` will all be
overriden by repo-level `5m`.

    default_time_window: "7d"

    host_configs {
      key: "chromium"
      value: {
        clean_revert_time_window: "1h"
        repo_configs {
          key: "infra/experimental"
          value: {
            clean_revert_pattern {
              time_window: "5m"
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }

`excluded_paths` defines files/directories that always require a human to
review. If a revert modifies any file that is contained in `excluded_paths`,
the revert will not be approved by Rubber-Stamper. The syntax of
`excluded_paths` is the same as that of `.gitignore` files. Gitignore file
syntax is documented in [gitignore](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore). In the
following sample config, any revert that changes `a/b.md` or any files ending
in `.go` will not be approved.

    clean_revert_pattern {
      excluded_paths: "a/b.md"
      excluded_paths: "*.go"
    }

#### Examples of clean cherry-pick patterns
A cherry-pick will be approved if:
1. The current revision doesn't make any file changes compared with the initial
revision;
2. It is within the configured `time_window` in the config;
3. It is cherry-picked after the original CL has been merged;
4. None of the modified files is in the `excluded_paths`;
5. It is marked as mergeable by the Gerrit API
[GetMergeable](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/rest-api-changes.html#get-mergeable).

The format of `time_window` is the same as that for clean revert patterns,
which you can find in the section above. Similarly, a host-level value
(`clean_cherry_pick_time_window` in `host_configs`) can override the global
value (`default_time_window`), while a repo-level value (`time_window` in
`clean_cherry_pick_pattern` of `repo_configs`) can override the host-level
value.

The format of `excluded_paths` is also the same as that for clean revert
patterns.

Here is an example of a clean cherry-pick pattern. Any cherry-pick that is
cherry-picked more than 3 hours ago or modifies any files ending in `.md`
will not be approved.

    clean_cherry_pick_pattern {
      time_window: "3h"
      excluded_paths: "*.md"
    }

##### Bypass File Check
We also provide a way to bypass file check in clean cherry-pick patterns, that
is, all the cherry-pick rules still apply except "The current revision doesn't
make any file changes compared with the initial revision".

The cherry-pick needs to meet the following requirements:
1. The file changes between the initial revision and current revision will only
be in configured `included_paths`.
2. The CL should have a configured `hashtag`.
3. The CL owner has to be one of `allowed_owners`.

Here is an example of clean cherry-pick pattern with a bypassFileCheck rule.

    clean_cherry_pick_pattern {
      time_window: "3h"
      excluded_paths: "*.md"

      file_check_bypass_rule {
        included_paths: "dir/*.md"
        hashtag: "Example-Hashtag"
        allowed_owners: "user@example.com"
      }
    }
